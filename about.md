Ah, what about me?

Maybe [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public), inspired by [lee](https://leebyron.com/til/).

Ok, I will add things I believe first, which should update itself every so often; I will also add things I've learned along this journey.

Things i believe -

1. “make mistakes of ambition and not mistakes of sloth.” — machiavelli. i would rather constantly bite more than i can chew, than settle for mediocrity and never know the extent of my capabilities.

1. startups
   - if you're a young technical team, you're better off focusing on building extraordinary product/tech advantage than picking distribution battles. creating software has never been easier, and thus, non-technical people with distribution are no longer at a disadvantage in most markets. the "tech" arbitrage opportunity is vanishing.

1. people
   - be kind, be direct and transparent. life is short.
   - don't be a gatekeeper, you lose out on compounding.
   - moments are fleeting, people endure.


1. enthusiasm matters.
    - easier and more fun to work on things that feel exciting to me.
    - energy is a necessary input for progress.

1. smaller teams are better.
    - faster decision, fewer meetings.
    - "No need to chop up work for political reasons"
    - tech co are probabaly 3x-10x overstaffed.

1. less is more
    - always remove fluff.
    - remove overbearing info.

1. what excites me?
    - make things. Get stuff done.
    - i like working with people who challenge and expand my worldviews.
