I heard about ai search since maybe more than 2 months ago, and now I'm seeing a plethora of ai search websites. Crazy maze.

A few interesting sites on ai search
- https://exa.ai/
- https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/exa

- https://search.lepton.run/
- first announced in https://x.com/jiayq/status/1750935085564764224 (1/24/24, Yangqing Jia)

Perplexity is also a good option. I found Bing search helpful maybe a few months back, but tend to use more perplexity ai recently.
