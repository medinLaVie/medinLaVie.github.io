I heard about ai search since maybe more than 2 months ago, and now I'm seeing a plethora of ai search websites. Crazy maze.

A few interesting sites on ai search
- https://exa.ai/
- https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/exa

- https://search.lepton.run/
- first announced in https://x.com/jiayq/status/1750935085564764224 (1/24/24, Yangqing Jia)

Perplexity is also a good option. I found Bing search helpful maybe a few months back, but tend to use more perplexity ai recently.
1. chatgpt now supports search
1. microsoft copilot search (when it was initially launched, it was pretty good.)
1. gemini
1. perplexity
