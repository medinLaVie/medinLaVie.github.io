Actually,
this is the first post to the public—
a musing on the beginning.

Remember the past,
mindful of the present,
ready for the future.
Writing for your own brand—
you own the reputation.
No copycats here;
you carve your own paths.

As I share these words,
I confront my own fears:
fearing not living up
to the expectations,
fearing being seen
as a fake,
fearing a traumatic failure.

Holy Crap.
So Much at Stake.

Now, I'm actually starting to write this—
the internet will have memories.
Fail, and the fall is public,
traumatic in front of everyone.

Having hidden my flaws before,
I now face the vulnerability
of exposing them.

No more hiding behind the curtains,
no more safety.
Enter the sea of danger and wonder.
