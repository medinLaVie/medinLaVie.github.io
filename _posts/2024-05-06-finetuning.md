A Recipe for Training Neural Networks 
- a collection of attempted advice for training neural nets with a focus on how to structure that process over time

## Common Mistakes
most common neural net mistakes: 1) you didn't try to overfit a single batch first. 2) you forgot to toggle train/eval mode for the net. 3) you forgot to .zero_grad() (in pytorch) before .backward(). 4) you passed softmaxed outputs to a loss that expects raw logits. ; others? :)

## TWeets
New open weights LLM from 
@MistralAI


params.json:
- hidden_dim / dim = 14336/4096 => 3.5X MLP expand
- n_heads / n_kv_heads = 32/8 => 4X multiquery
- "moe" => mixture of experts 8X top 2 ðŸ‘€
