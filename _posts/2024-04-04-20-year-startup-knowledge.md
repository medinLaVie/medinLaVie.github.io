# Spicy Takes
1. Corporate job security in is an illusion right now. Somehow it's more safe to be an entrepreneur with no health insurance than working at a mid-level job at Google.
1. The average software engineering job is one of those jobs that’s going to get automated like crazy. The days of a computer science intern getting $10k/month right out of college are soon gone.
1. `AI will put hundreds of thousands out of work.` When I scroll through X, I see people saying there’s zero chance that AI replaces jobs, arguing “It will make them more productive.” I don’t think so. It’s not rocket science. If they are more productive, there will be less need for people. Those people will have other jobs. Am I missing something here?

1. No-one is talking about how Discord opened up their platform for apps a few days ago. All of a sudden you have access to their 200M users. Fortunes will be made.
1. Creators become the next presidents and prime ministers. We saw reality TV stars and celebrities become presidents—Trump, Schwarzenegger etc. Soon, creators will be too. Ron DeSantis spent $6,831 for every vote he received this year. Wild. If it cost Biden the same thing, and he gets as many votes as in 2020, he will have spent $550 billion dollars getting elected. Creators will be way more efficient at distribution than legacy politicians, for better or worse.
1. `The average founder of a GPT wrapper company will make more money than the average venture-backed AI startup`. The talent war among venture-backed AI companies is fierce. If you can keep your GPT wrapper startup really niche and under 5 employees, you’ll probably do well. ChatGPT is getting unbundled, and unbundled fast.
1. You’ll swap LLMs like you change your clothes. People think ChatGPT will be the next Google, but the reality is the next Google will be spread out among hundreds of LLMs.

# Growth Hacks

1. Boring Marketing: My secret weapon for organic growth. Their AI-driven SEO tactics are next level. If you want to boost your business through organic/Google Search, these guys will blow you away with what they can do. ✅
1. ​You Probably Need A Robot: With over 60,000 people learning about AI and automation, this community is a goldmine for those eager to dive into AI. I'm still exploring its business potential, but the learning opportunity here is phenomenal. ✅




# 20 Years of startup Knowledge
1. Jargon almost never helps your case. The simplest sentences make things happen.
1. There are no guarantees in business. Right now, Google is a $2 trillion dollar company walking around with their pants on fire because of AI. Even Google can get disrupted. Just because your business is doing well today, doesn’t it mean it will tomorrow. All we have with 100% certainty is today.
1. Avoid “trust me” people. Constantly the most untrustworthy people.
1. 3 types of goals to hold sacred. Your someday goals. Your 1 year goals. Your daily goals. Everything else doesn’t matter.
1. I used to think a low follower to followee ratio was cool. Now I think the opposite. Avoid people who play status games.
1. More direct reports you have, the more stress you'll have. That's okay. Just have to acknowledge it.
1. Nothing is out of reach. I remember that feeling, on the come up. Top people felts unreachable. They’re just like you.
1. Everything is a drug. Coffee is a drug. Food is a drug. Travel is a drug. Business is a drug. Deals are drugs. Use accordingly.
1. When someone uses your product, they are having a dialogue with you. It’s kinda spiritual. Will they understand your vision like you do?
1. Whenever you’re frustrated with business or life, get up and reset with music. For me, it’s reggae. I can’t be mad at life when reggae is playing.
1. Find all your business partners from either people you grew up with or people you find fascinating on the internet, and nothing in between.
1. How to hire: based on integrity, grit and how quickly (and willing) they are to learn.
15. Replace the words `revenue` and `valuation`, with `profit` and `impact`. Good things will happen and you’ll sleep like a baby.
16. Wake up thinking of `cash-flow`, go to sleep thinking of cash-flow. Being dependent on anyone is always less than ideal. Zuck or VCs. The more cash flow you have, the less dependencies you have.
17. If you want to write an angry email, wait 24h and see if you’d word it differently tomorrow. `Hard to write good emails when you're angry`.
18. Bad copy kills businesses, good copy makes them.
19. The wrong customers will drive you crazy. Sometimes I’ll see a wonderful team and product, but they just focused on the wrong customers. So the business ends up sucking. Founders end up ripping their hair out.
20. Find invigoration trips. Trips that give you a dose of inspiration. You feel like a new person. Could be your favorite coffeeshop to 24h in a cabin in the woods. `Know you invigoration places and visit often`.
21. If you sell on the internet, you’re a `dopamine dealer` whether you want to admit it or not.
22. Be busy `creating`, not consuming. Consuming is overvalued and creating is undervalued.
23. Follow what competitors are doing, but don’t obsess over it.
24. “10 people who yell make more noise than 10,000 people who are silent”
25. No amount of marketing can save a lousy product.
26. No-one should work at a company for 12+ years. It’s too comfortable.
27. `Leverage` makes you superhuman. Leveraging automations. Leveraging AI. Leveraging community. Leveraging code.
28. Your quality of life increases when you screen time goes down.You’re more productive and happy.
29. People underestimate a good name for a product. Own a good name. Bonus points if its a `dotcom`. The internet rewards `catchy` names.
30. When you get rejected,I always remind myself: something about getting rejected makes you want it more. Helps with focus too.
31. The real minimum viable product is just a social post. You’ll validate more than 99% of MVPs through a tweet or an IG post.
32. When you’re thirsty, it’s too late to be thinking about digging a well
33. We often undervalue what we have and overvalue what we don’t have
34. Don’t follow growth hacks. If someone is telling you about them, it’s too late
35. Accept pain, don’t suffer (pain is inevitable, suffering is optional)
36. T-shirt test. Your brand should be so good people want to wear it on t-shirts.
37. Give customers a little more than they expect. “Bonuses” go a long way.
38. Start even if you’re bad. Get going then get good.
39. You don't need a green card to the US to "make it" and be wealthy anymore. You need to show up on the internet consistently and get loud.
40. Everyone is in the acquisition and retention business. You're either attracting customers or keeping customers. Usually both. Be confident in how you’re doing it.
41. You’ll be a lot less happy (and wealthy) if you do what other people expect of you.
42. Following the trend is a status game and trends don’t usually work out. Way too competitive. It’s “cool” to zig, it pays to zag.
43. The trends that change the world are the ones that are part-inspiring, part-frightening.
44. If you want to get into the right room, write well.
45. How to come up with startup ideas: Virtual travel. Go to TikTok, Discords and Subreddits to understand what people want.
46. Startup killers: Multi-tasking, too much capital, too little capital, perfectionism, not obsessed enough over details, too obsessed over competition, team burnout, constant pivots, no distribution, no fun anymore.
47. The moment you start caring about what other people think, is the moment you start building your company like them
48. Life is full of hidden taxes that slow you down. Taxes to keep in mind: attention tax, social tax, boss tax, commute taxes etc. What life taxes are slowing you down?
49. Real feedback from colleagues, customers, bosses, investors is sobering. Seek it.
50. The fastest way to grow your IG is to start a TikTok. The fastest way to grow a newsletter is to grow your X account. The fastest way to build a community is to make internet friends. The fastest way start a startup is to press publish on an idea.
51. If you send a customer a marketing email, it better be good. Your trust is at stake.
52. Get HD clear on WHO you're making it for, before WHAT you're making
53. Life's too short and there's too much opportunity on the internet for you to hate what you do. If it isn't fun, find something else. If it's fun, enjoy every second.
