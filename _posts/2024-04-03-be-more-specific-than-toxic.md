> Calling people and team "toxic" is rarely helpful. It focuses on their impact instead of their actions.

GPT
Saying a person or team is "toxic" doesn't really help. It looks at the effect they have, not what they're doing wrong.

I found a tweet this morning that made a lot of sense.



It said we should be clear and specific when we talk about bad behavior. Just using vague, negative words like "toxic" doesn't do much good, even if we're just thinking them.

A useful warning tells you exactly what actions are causing problems and keeps happening.

## The Toxic Five
1. `Being disrespectful`: Not treating others with the respect they deserve.
1. `Not including everyone`: This covers a lot of areas like not being fair to LGBTQ+ people, people with disabilities, different races, ages, genders, and showing favoritism or nepotism.
1. `Being unethical`: Doing things that are wrong, lying, or not following rules.
1. `Being overly competitive`: Hurting others to get ahead, like backstabbing or being overly harsh.
1. `Being abusive`: Bullying, harassing, or being mean to others.
