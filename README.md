`rvm install ruby` has been stuck on my laptop for 5m+. I gave up. I'm going to use github workplace as it seems more convenient. 

I meant to check out the github workplace more often, as an alternative. Yay! both ruby/gem/jekyll up-to-date versions were already installed. 

It takes only 1 min to setup the workplace, and I'm ready to code. 

Github Workplace is pretty cool. (at least, I found the experience pleasant so far.)

Pros: 
- agnostic to the local compute resource.
- perfect to write a blog / fix a bug on the personal site.  


Cons: 
- requires good network 


Okay, now I just have to find the right jekyll templates.

How to add a page? 
Say, if you want to add /about /projects /contact. How do you do that? 
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pages/
- add an HTML file 
- add a markdown file

```
.
├── about.md    # => http://example.com/about.html
├── index.html    # => http://example.com/
└── contact.html  # => http://example.com/contact.html
```
